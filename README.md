# Poker
A poker hand library in C#.

## AWA.Poker
This is a library for evaluating poker hands. As written it can evaluate
5 card poker hands. This was originally written to solve Project Euler problem #54.

## euler54
This is the Project Euler #54 solution

## HackerRank
This project is the HackerRank solution that corresponds to euler #54. Since you can 
only submit code in a single text box, this solution is a single file. 

## TexasHoldemBot (10/2018)
This project plays poker in an online competition. I'm not saying which one, but if
you are familiar with the ones out there then it shouldn't be too dificult to 
figure out which one. 

## CodinGame (11/2019)
This is a solution for the Very Difficult Texas Holdem challenge on the CodinGame
web site. I basically pulled in the the required parts from the TexasHoldemBot and
made it spit out the required output. I also discovered some bugs in TexasHoldemBot
while I did this, so it would be interesting to see if I could improve the performance
of the bot if they ever bring back the competition.
