## AWA.Poker
This is a library for evaluating poker hands. As written it can evaluate
5 card poker hands. This was originally written to solve Project Euler problem #54.

## euler54
This is the Project Euler #54 solution

## HackerRank
This project is the HackerRank solution that corresponds to euler #54. Since you can 
only submit code in a single text box, this solution is a single file. 

## TexasHoldemBot
This project plays poker in an online competition. I'm not saying which one, but if
you are familiar with the ones out there then it shouldn't be too dificult to 
figure out which one.
